===========================================
Python prototype of the path tracer.
===========================================

1. Use Python3 for prototyping instead of 
   spending years (a hilarious joke) to implement
   this path tracer in c++
2. Use TkInter for the GUI. 
   Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create 
   Graphical User interfaces (GUIs).

   In order to check if TkInter is installed on your system,
   execute the following commands in a Python console:
   >>> import tkinter
   >>> tkinter._test()

===========================================
   TODOs:
    - Use TkInter to create a simple window
    - Show an image from the local file system in 
      the window (OpenCV is the simplest way?)
    - Modify (alter) some pixels in the image 
      in order to test that this dumb solution
      might be used to draw rendering results 
      from the path tracer.
