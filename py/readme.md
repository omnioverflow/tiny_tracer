===========================================
Python prototype of the path tracer.
===========================================

1. Use Python3 for prototyping instead of 
   spending years (a hilarious joke) to implement
   this path tracer in c++
2. Use TkInter for the GUI. 
   Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create 
   Graphical User interfaces (GUIs).

   In order to check if TkInter is installed on your system,
   execute the following commands in a Python console:
   >>> import tkinter
   >>> tkinter._test()
